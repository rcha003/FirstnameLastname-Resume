        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Ryan Cha. I have extensive work experience at several different places over the past 5 years. This includes but is not limited to working as a cashier, cook, coach, and server. My first job was at a burger restaurant, in which I initially worked as a dish washer but moved up to overseeing other employees as well as beginning to cook and take orders. My next job began at my local bowling alley, in which I worked as a front desk assistant and cashier. Due to it being understaffed, I often had to take on roles such as serving food to customers, setting up events, and helping with machine maintenance. This job helped me learn to become more flexible in my ability to learn and work. The job that I began after was coaching for powerlifting, in which I took on several clients to help them learn how to get stronger in the gym, as well as maintain good physical health. I was led by the #2 83kg powerlifter in the United States at the time, and it was a great experience working with like minded individuals with the goal of getting stronger and being the best versions of themselves. My final job was working as a server at my local sushi restaurant. This job was one of the most difficult experiences of my life, as the working conditions were not particularly good, but I did gain valuable experience such as multitasking.<br><br>
